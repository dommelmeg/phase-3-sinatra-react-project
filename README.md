# Phase 3 Project: Bookworm

A single page app that allows you to keep track of the books you've read & keep a wish list of the books you want to read. You can also leave notes/comments and ratings for each book.

## Backend Setup
Fork and clone the repo by clicking the green code button at the top right, copy the SSH URL.

Type the following code into your terminal & replace URL with the one you just copied.

```bash
git clone URL
```

This will copy all the files from this repo down to your computer.

### Installation

 Run `bundle install` to install the gems.

You can start the server with:

```

This will run the server on port
